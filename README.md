## Knight's Travails for TOP

My (again) very first implementation of a graph data structure!

The approach I chose this time was an adjacency list (or hash)
and a recursive function to take care of the combinatorics.

### Possible improvements:
- Optimize find_route_recursive method
- Add an animation for when the knight moves
- Allow the user to input their desired moves
